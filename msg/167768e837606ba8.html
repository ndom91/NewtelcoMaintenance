Hi Andreas,



Noted on the scheduled work for permanent fix.



But we need to know whether after the problematic route is fixed, are you going to move back the service to its original route?

Or this current route will be permanent.

Dear Glenn,



please see our partner update below.



„ Dear colleagues, currently, the line is still stable since 14:32 UTC 26.11.2018, there was no any line flap, but we are still seeing errors.

An urgent work is arranged on 29.11.2018 since 20:00 UTC to 00:00 30.11.2018. Scheduled to check/replace an optical patch cord on our site in S.Petersburg.

I will confirm this maintenance window later.



P.S. Your service is now working on the route without errors.

Hi Newtelco,



Just to confirm the following, service will not take any impact during the repair, correct?

Also, once repair completed, are you moving the service back to the designated route?

Dear colleagues,



our partners update:



„the problem has been localized -  there is an optical level decrease in S.Petersburg.

We have added 4 dBm manually, but the level is still not has enough value, it is at the lower bound. The line Moscow – S.Petersburg is working now, but scheduled to perform an optical measurement and carry out the repair work. We will provide you an ETR once available.

Currently, your service is working on another route, without any alarm.  „
