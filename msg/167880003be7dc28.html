Please be informed that the content of the planned work is to replace a
fragment of backbone fiber-optic cable. The cable is located on the pylons
of contact power network of Russian Railways. Since the work can be carried
out only in the absence of trains and only at daylight, all the
technological "windows" are planned in advance, and the work itself is
performed by Russian Railways personnel who are allowed to work at the
power lines, we are sorry to inform you that we can not reschedule the
planned work.
                     We would like to sincerely apologize for the
                     inconvenience caused.
Best regards,
Dmitrii Nikitin
