Dear Achonu



I don’t work with prices, my colleagues will check and inform is it worth
or not to move it to East or keep it in North.



Bur I think we keep it as is now.

Hi Okey,



Did you manage to discuss service OGYX/127405//ZYO (Legacy ID: WP2P33030)
with NewTelco, as per below email chain. Service is currently terminated in
Telehouse North but Nodar at NewTelco would like to know associated MRC/NRC
charges for moving it to Telehouse East.

We need a solution either way, at the earliest, as this service is part of

Thanks for your email. I have approval/budget to order x-connect within the

Dear Kamran



I have 1 question regarding that circuit, actually that circuit is going
from old Viatel Positions to Telehouse North, TFM19, C12.

as I understand that connection should be changed right?



is it possible that new/replacement connection is delivered directly to
Telehouse East, TFM60, Rack B3?

Hi Andreas,



Thanks for your email. Yes, two-hour window is sufficient. Although we do
not anticipate outage to be more than 15 minutes we would like downtime to
be set at 30 minutes, to be on safe side.



Start:     14th November 20:00 GMT

Finish:    14th November 22:00 GMT
