Team,



Please mark racks 1935 and 1933 as reserved for Rascom.

Reserve needed for 1 month. After final decision customer move for one of
this racks from 1934. We book two nearest because in migration need to
understand what will be better to use current cross-connections.

We change order from 4 units for full rack. Power consumption without any
changes – 1kW



Best regards | Mit freundlichen Grüßen
