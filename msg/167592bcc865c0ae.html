Dear colleagues,
I got a bunch of questions regarding our LS NMS for the SDH network in Europe. Some of them I can handle locally. But some of them require the assistance from NT to give the answers.
Here is the list.

1. Exact address of RDR server location.
2. Total number of configured LS NMS user accounts (number and the list).
3. Access to the LS servers administration via Web-interface. If yes what is the security setup?
4. LS user password setup:
- password format restrictions (number of symbols etc.)
- Number of unsuccessful password entering attempts before user blocking.
- User unblock - manual or automatic after timeout?
5. What protocol do you use for the LS servers and NMS access from NT office? Who is granted with such an access (quantity of technicians)?
6. Events and Security logging and storage details (how often, where is stored, capacity).
7. DB and System settings Backup setup: parameters (how often, where is stored, capacity).

And also non-technical question. Who in NT is responsible for the handling of contractual issues between NT and RT (the contract owner or such)?

I have only one or two business days to compile the whole answers in one document. Sorry for such a short notice, I actually got this request only yesterday and your prompt support would be really appreciated.

Many thanks for your help.

Dear Pavel

On this diagram nothing is located in our Office, everything is located in Datacenter.

NT NCEX is our Ethernet Platform by which we provide Ethernet services to customer, technically it is Juniper MX9600.

Dear Nodar,
Many thanks! Good job.
One question so far – what is NT NCEX? Is it located in the Datacenter or in your office? I thought that there is only switch labeled at the diagram as NT SWITCH.

Dear Nodar, colleagues,
I need your assistance to fulfill the internal request I’ve recently got.
Could you please provide a simple drawing that would depict the current topology and configuration of the DCN network for ECI Europe including Frankfurt and Stockholm? Your assistance within reasonable timeframe would be highly appreciated.

Dear Pavel

Currently topology seems is very different

If you wish we can have phone conversation and I’ll explain you how it is working now.

Also yesterday I forgot to mention, that there is RDR server which is located in our Datacenter.

So in our datacenter to DCM there are connected 2 x XDM elements, 1 X Server, 1 IP address for management from NewTelco Office and 2 Uplinks (1st Moscow, 2nd Stockholm)

About security nobody can access DCN network from internet because there is NAT only for translating NewTelco OFFICE addresses to that network.

About security and ACL as you said, I’m afraid it might provide bad results, also you wont be able to set same ACL to RDR server.

Currently ports which I remember and which are in use are:

SSH (TCP 22), FTP (TCP 20,21), VNC (TCP 5900-5910) and others I don’t remember, I can ask which ports should be open from ECI, but I still think better not to do it between XDM elements and NMS server.

Dear Nodar,
Looks like NT Catalyst 3550 is a shared resource for several applications and also has a potential connection to the public Internet. According to RT security rules it is not allowed for the DCN network. As a @first aid@ RT could take steps like this: to configure acl towards Frankfurt end. Could you provide the list of ports that are in use by NMS and NT? We could leave only these particular ports opened in RT switch in Moscow.
I also discovered that during handover of DCN and ECI Europe administration to me from Alexey I haven’t got any up to date Agreement updates. I will try to find them locally inside the company, but if you have at least the up-to-date DCN network diagram – could you please share it with me? I only have the one in attachment.

Many thanks in advance!
If you need clarifications please let me know, we can discuss over the phone also.

Dear Pavel

In Stockholm there is unmanaged Netgear switch where all your XDM management is connected.

In Frankfurt there is our own switch, our switch is cisco Catalyst 3550.

Here are interfaces:

Fa0/9                          up             up       ### XDM1K Rostelecom FRA2 ::: IP: 10.12.10.162 ::: ###

Fa0/12                         up             up       ### Rostelecom MGMT MSK+STK, FRA2, I5/10, Moscow ###

There is flexlink between fa0/12 and fa0/11

All of these ports are in vlan 1012:

In that vlan we have also router which is connected by only one IP address and we are making NAT to connect to your NMS from our office,

Here is config of our nat:

as you see on port fa0/11 and fa0/12 no spaning-tree is working because of flexlink

I can’t provide you other information from switch because it is used not only for your DCN connection, we run on it our corporative and internal traffic.

If you review to rebuild topology to be more independent then new equipment is needed which is up to additional agreement, I think.

I would really prefer to have Rostelecom’s network completely independent and connect to it by only 1 connection, in this case redundancy should be also be provided by RT.

Dear Nodar, colleagues,
I got a request from my colleague who is responsible for DCN network in Moscow regarding DCN switches setup in Stockholm and Frankfurt. I am not sure are these devices Cisco-type or not, however the request from my colleague looks as follows.
Please provide the output of the following commands:

show running-config
show spanning-tree vlan
show spanning-tree interface interface detail
show spanning-tree active
show dot1q-tunnel [interface if-range]
show l2protocol tunnel [interface if-range| vlan vlan-id]
