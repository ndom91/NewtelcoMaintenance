Hi Nodar,

 

How do we pay the service fee? Can I pay it with my own bank account? The fee will not be paid by Gemnet.

 

Thanks&Regards,

Tugsuu

Dear Tugsuu

monitor and keyboard arr already tools, and it will be level2/3 technical support.

Remote hands is like reporting physical satus of equipment (on on off) and it also includes small physical works inside racks like powering on/off, moving patchcord, restarting.

Hi Nodar,

 

Thank you for the information. I will let you know once I confirm with my team.

BTW, can we ask RHS: "Remote Hands: advice and tasks not requiring the use of tools*" for connecting display and keyboard to the server and enter 2 line commands by on-site engineer ?

 

Thanks&Regards,

Tugsuu

Hi,

 

Thank you for your reply.

We need KVM access only once. Can we ask the service for a temporary access, one-time access?

 

Thanks&Regards,
