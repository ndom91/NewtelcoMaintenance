Dear Nikola

 

If you use double tagged frames with outer tag 1305 then you will get encapsulation with orange

 

Just change configuration on your port, and write “vlan tags outer 1305 inner 205” instead of “vlan-id 1305’

 

And you will have vlan 205 facing Orange

 

Best regards | Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Hi Nodar,

Thanks for reply.

They said that they have encapsulation configured on their side.

Dear Nikola

 

There are no connection with Vodafona on Vlan 205, 

 

with Europeer  we have only Vlan 1301-1305, from which only Vlan 1305 is Orange.

 

If you need configuration change we won’t be able to fulfill your request because ordering contact is Veon and request should be initialized from them.

 

But, if you use secondary Vlan (C-vlan), then your will be transported transparently till Oragne:

 

On your side circuit will be looking next way:

 

Europeer ß Outer Vlan: 1305, Inner Vlan: 205 à NewTelco ß Vlan 205 à Orange

Dear NewTelco,

Can you please confirm that ports are configured on your side for connection between Europeer and Orange CID 012946.

And could you also tell what is port configuration on Orange side, is it access or trunk (vlan 205).
