Hi Nodar.

Interesting story at long distance with multiple operators ...
There might be an issue with the order of VCs inside the EOS-VCG.
We know that some other vendor equipment needs a certain order of VCs inside the group
and if they get the VCs in mixed order, they can not recreate the complete group.
This result is reduced capacity or complete loss.

The idea to deactivate and activate goes into the correct direction.
In similar scenario, deactivate till the first VC - thus you have reduced capacity but still something.
Then add (activate) VCs one by one and check with the other side which/that it got activated ...
-> probably you will find out the VC mix  (if not you can still force the trace to check)

Subject: Compatibility with Cisco EoS

Hello

For last week we were having problems with EoS between our XDM1000 with DIOB card and Cisco 15454

We have 600mbps EoS circuit (4xVC4) and it had some problems.

There were no alarms, but some VC4s in TX direction weren’t activated, for example 4 xVC4 were working fine on RX traffic, but on TX one of these 4 x VC4 wasn’t sending any traffic, it had state “DNU” (as I remember), and when I was de-activating and activating it’s status it was changing status to add.

Some VC4 were jumping from Norm to DNU state, that problem was only in TX directions, full 600mbps was received and when we were providing HW loopback only 450 or sometimes 300mbps come back.

Yesterday had same problem, de-activating/activating of TX didn’t helped, but after I placed loop on SNK, facility Loopback (Far End), after removal of loop all 4 x VC4 start working in normal condition and were providing 600mbps in both directions.

We are using, XDM1000, with DIOB cards,  and SW version on NE is 91.132,  on DIOB SW version is 91.130.

On opposite side there is Cisco 15454 with SW Version: 08.52-008E-25.04 and card CE-MR-10

Distance is very big, about 7 000 km, circuit is going from UK, London till Kazakhstan, Atyrau

Do you know any known issues with compatibly with Cisco? I do not remember any similar problems with any other vendors.

Best regards | Mit freundlichen Grüßen
