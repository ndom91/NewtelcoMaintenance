*Betreff:* RE: fiber patch panel install



Dear NewTelco,



We’re still having issues with fiber interconnect in Equinix FR5 and kindly
ask your assistance.

It’s related to previous project where you helped us to install router and
connect it to fiber panel. (see below)

Would you be able to measure optical signal level there?



Connections as should be:

Ubiquity EdgePro router 2 fiber ports connected to black panel 1130966
ports 1,2.

From panel it should have wires going out to meet me room for
CenturyLink/Level3 marked

1-159452413638

1-175662457421



Request:



On first port:

We see light and remote side sees the light. Request to first disconnect so
we can make sure remote side sees it down, then loop back to us so we see
counters incrementing, then restore the circuit



On second port:

We see no light, FR5 side sees no light from us.

See if there’s possible swap of RX/TX fibers, measure signal levels from
patch panel to all directions. We’ll see our next steps from there.



Request to dispatch an engineer during work hours in the afternoon. Today
will work too.

Dear NewTelco Team,



Please review the following request:



   1. Fiber panel that you installed for us in September in Equinix was
   rejected by Equinix as “not supported type”. We cannot use it and would
   like to return.
   2. You received a new package with a router and a HDD for installation
   and we would like to request remote hands support today-tomorrow after
   16:00 your time.



Requested remote hands support.



   1. Newly arrived package has a harddrive. This should go to Room 2.17
   Rack 2709, server marked PSXFG. Bay3 reports failed so please remove and
   discard old drive and install the one received.



   1. Rest of remote support will be in Equinix location Room 3.13, Row 8,
   Place 5/6, Rack #0806
      1. Install new router in place of fiber panel that you installed in
      September. Fiber connections from the back of panel need to be moved to
      port 1&2 of the black fiber panel marked 1130966. Front
connections, if any
      need to go to black fiber panel as well.
      2. Migrate SFPs from EdgeSwitch12 ports 1&2 to new router. Connect
      fibers from backside of black panel to it.
      3. Connect router to power (can reuse power cord of EdgeSwitch12),
      connect to serial console with shipped cable+adapter and connect copper
      ports 1& 2 to Riverstone router ports 2.4 and 2.6 respectively.



Please confirm date/time and a person doing the work. I will check and
print out access list so we don’t have problems with access.



Thank you very much!



Ilya Belov

Dear Ilya,



unfortunately we could not complete the smart hands order completely.



We have some questions:



1)
R&R Side: FR5:03:M31300 - PP:0806:179995 - Ports 1, 2 *** (likely is
connected already to the panel)
Level3 side: FR5:03:M314S1 - PP:0402:003132:218625-3 - Ports 31, 32

In both ports there are connecting fibers to one of these cards. (There are
no hanging cable)

[image: cid:image001.jpg@01D48AE9.34254DA0]



The ports are up and we don’t touch them.

2)
R&R Side: FR5:03:M31300 – NEW PANEL port 2  *** (need to connect to front
side of new panel)
Level3 side: FR5:03:M314S1 - PP:0402:003132:218625-3 - Ports 65, 66

We could not identify the panel 100%. Wich panel you mean with NEW PANEL?
The black one (PP:0806:1130966)?

The grey one is the new panel we have installed today.



[image: cid:image002.jpg@01D48AE9.34254DA0]





3)

From patch panels run two SC-LC cables to Ubiquity Fiber Switch port 1 & 2
respectfully



We don’t found Ubiquity Fiber Switch.

Just this one: EdgeSwitch12



[image: cid:image003.jpg@01D48AE9.34254DA0]



Please confirm that is the right one.



Today we have precablet port 1 and 2 from our new installed panel (grey) to
port 1 and 2 from EdgeSwitch12.

Is that correct?



We don't understand how to connect between the Panels correct.



Please send us a cabling plan with the help of the pictures attached.

Hello Svetlana,



All 3 engineers were added to our access list.



OK with pricing for patch panel. We don’t need 12 fiber cables but please
take with you two SC-LC singlemode cables in case you don’t find provided
cables in the Equinix rack.







Equinix location:



CarrierDomain/R&R

Room 3.13, Row 8, Place 5/6

Rack #0806







Circuit details:



Two SC fiber cables coming from MMR “Century Link/Level3”

First one is likely already terminated to existing fiber panel port 1.

Second one is likely hanging loose in the rack.



I don’t have information how circuits were marked but here are IDs from the
order. Maybe they used numbering from the order…

Equinix-Order Nr. 1-159452413638;  Request ID# 9-166781647615

1)
R&R Side: FR5:03:M31300 - PP:0806:179995 - Ports 1, 2 *** (likely is
connected already to the panel)
Level3 side: FR5:03:M314S1 - PP:0402:003132:218625-3 - Ports 31, 32

2)
R&R Side: FR5:03:M31300 – NEW PANEL port 2  *** (need to connect to front
side of new panel)
Level3 side: FR5:03:M314S1 - PP:0402:003132:218625-3 - Ports 65, 66



3)

From patch panels run two SC-LC cables to Ubiquity Fiber Switch port 1 & 2
respectfully



4)

Please make pictures of the rack, one for top and one for bottom,  each
side. Send us 4 pictures.
