Hi all

 

Nico has added tab in our CRM, for projects in Bearbeitung status.

 

Bu that we can see which projects are in bearbeitung and who is working with them.

 

Please check that link:

 

https://crm.newtelco.de/projects/report/index/type/inbearbeitung

 

here you can see all projects which are in work,

 

it shows all “Beschribung” and “Status Technik” values too, and when Order pass AK to Service, please write it down in Beschreibung,  service will write assigned engineer in “Technik Status” 

 

by that we can keep track of all opened Projects and avoid confusions.

 

Also please review all these projects there are many in Bearbeitung state which are very old please close them or change status/

 

 

Best regards | Mit freundlichen Grüßen
