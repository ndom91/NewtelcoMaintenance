We would like to inform you about a planned maintenance work on the CID

Reason:

The nature of this work is to perform a Network Element card replacement.
This work is required to maintain the integrity and reliability of the core
DWDM transport network. Currently this is a passive alarm and the equipment
should be replaced before a failure becomes service affecting and results in
a prolonged outage to customer services. During the maintenance window you
may experience one period of outage to the maximum specified below. 


Location:

ST POELTEN, Austria


Impact:

The circuit is protected and can experience only a 50ms protection switch
hit.

 

We sincerely regret causing any inconveniences by this and hope for your
understanding and the further mutually advantageous cooperation.

 

If you have any questions feel free to contact us.

 

 

Best regards | Mit freundlichen Grüßen
