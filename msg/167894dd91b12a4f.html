Thanks for the confirmation Nikoloz. We are scheduling/progressing as
planned at our end.



Early next week NewTelco will have to raise a ticket to Telehouse to swap
old x-connect with the new one.



I will confirm details once x-connect has been delivered.



Have a nice weekend.

Hi Nikoloz,



B-End: 8/9 Harbour Exchange is now an Equinix Site. As our demarcation for
new equipment at this site will change, we are requesting Equinix to move
our end of the x-connect to our new rack. NewTelco end of the x-connect
will remain unchanged.





At A End: London Telehouse North we are arranging new x-connect between
Zayo and NewTelco racks.



Hope this answers your question but please do not hesitate if further
information is required.







Thanks
