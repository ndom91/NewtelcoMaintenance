Dear Valued Customer/Transport Partner,

We would like to announce that Epsilon is implementing a Network Freeze and the period is as follows:

Start Date and Time:  17 December 2018 00:01 GMT
End Date and Time:    04 January 2019 23:59 GMT

This freeze period is due to the upcoming year-end holidays (Christmas and New Year). Within this timeframe, we will not accept and perform any major network changes.

Any non-emergency activity will be ruled out, unless there is an exception approved by the Epsilon Management. Troubleshooting and support will not be impacted.


Activities that will not be performed during this time is:
-          Software upgrades
-          Network topology modifications

Activities that will still take place:
-          Patching of customer services
-          Network/site audits
-          Customer and network troubleshooting

Should you have any queries and need to make changes to the name list for notifications from Epsilon Telecommunications, please drop us an email to request-smc@epsilontel.com for maintenance and other requests and we will be glad to assist you.
